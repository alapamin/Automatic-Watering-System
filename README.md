# Automatic-Watering-System
This is an automatic watering system for my 12 year old bonsai tree. (I'm a proud tree dad).

This was a simple program developed in C++ on arduino uno for my bonsai tree that I was struggling to keep up with watering. 
I've been taking caring of the tree for over a year now and it's one of my favorite consistent habits, checking in and making sure the tree is well taken care of, because it honestly needs to be well taken care of to thrive. 

I've also attached a picture of it to the repo :).
